# OpenGL-Test

Everything works, except the Assimp binaries which I had problems compiling. Hence even the Model.h class does not work as it depends on Assimp, So you can't really import a model but you can still use the Mesh.h class to make your objects. <br /><br />
Also all the vertex data is in the main function, I couldnt bother to create a sandbox seperately. <br><br>
Unfortunately no time for me to continue this project right now as I've moved on to WebDev T-T.
